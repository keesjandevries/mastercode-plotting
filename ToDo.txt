* per file setup (cf config in mastercode-tools)
    i.e. dictionary:
        d = {
                "filename.root": 
                {
                    "planes"  : [ "iHist...." ]
                    "splines" : [ "iHist...." ]
                }
            }



* let the "grid" plot have all the plots: 
    ~ rows: diffent 1 or 2D spaces
    ~ collums: chi2 modes, chi2 contributions, lhood contributions, predictions
    (the reason is that it is easy to produce all at once)

* disentangle all plots from the grid from individual planes and splines

* make mastercode style contour overlays, with best fit point :)

* overlay prediction contours on chi2 plots or visa versa!
