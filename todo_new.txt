entry_histograms *don't* need MCchain as they only need to iterate one tree
(either chi2tree or contribtree)

Below also means there's no need for command line nonesense, it's all stored in
some file

have some class:
    contains:
    "File name"
    "dictionary": [ list of histogram names with options ]
    

    maybe:
    from collections import defaultdict

    class RFile( object ) :
        def __init__( self, fname ) :
            self.filename = fname
            self.plots = defaultdict(list)

        def add_plot( self, directory, hist_name, logx = False, logy = False ) :
            self.plots[directory].append( RPlot( hist_name, logx, logy ) )
    

    class RPlot( object ) :
        def __init__( self, hname, logx, logy, OPTIONS ) :
            self.name = hname
            self.logx = logx
            self.logy = logy
            self.PRETTY_TITLE = "OMG LOOK AT ME"
            # basically everything that defines the plot here
